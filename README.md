# yourls2pushbullet

A [YOURLs](https://yourls.org/) plugin for sending link click notifications via Pushbullet, inspired by [yourls-notifier](https://github.com/SosthenG/yourls-notifier/tree/main)

You will need the following:

- A YOURLS instance
- A [Pushbullet](https://help.pushbullet.com/) account
- An [Access Token](https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings/account) for your Pushbullet account
  
You can also opt to send notifications to a specific channel instead of your central feed by [creating your own channel](https://help.pushbullet.com/articles/what-are-pushbullet-channels/) via Pushbullet.

  
# How to install

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SosthenG/yourls-notifier/releases/latest) and drop the `yourls2pushbullet` folder in your `user/plugins` directory.

  
# How to use

Go to the 'Yourls2Pushbullet Settings' page and set your Access Token. If you don't have one, you need to create a Pushbullet account first.

Getting started is as easy as logging in with your Google account at the [Pushbullet website](https://www.pushbullet.com/).
